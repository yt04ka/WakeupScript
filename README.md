# WakeupScript
This is Python script that should wake me up when there is some activity on my screen

in main() there is an endless loop - firstly script takes a screenshot, then it waits 60 second to another one
then it compares two images - if they are same we go back to the beginning of loop, if not - it plays alarm.mp3
